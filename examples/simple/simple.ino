   This is simple sketch that uses the Espressif SoC's RMT peripheral to control
   Adafruit NeoPixels, FLORA RGB Smart Pixels, WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, SK6812, etc.

   written by : enjoyneering
   sourse code: https://github.com/enjoyneering/
   based on:    Adafruit_NeoPixel library v1.12.5

   RMT (Remote Control Peripheral) channels:
   - ESP32 has 8 RMT channels for sending & receiving infrared remote control
     signals. Can be assign to any GPIO pins
   - ESP32-S3 has 4 TX channels (to send) & 4 RX channels (to receive) channels for
     infrared remote control signals. DMA access for TX mode on channel 3 & for RX
     mode on channel 7

   ESP32 strapping pins:
   - GPIO0, internal pull-up
   - GPIO2, internal pull-down
   - GPIO4, internal pull-down
   - GPIO5, internal pull-up
   - GPIO12/MTDI, internal pull-down
   - GPIO15/MTDO, internal pull-up
   - GPIO0, 2, 4 & 15 cannot be used on ESP-WROVER due to external connections
     for PSRAM chip
   - GPIO34..39 input only pins. These pins donâ€™t have internal pull-up or
     pull-down resistors

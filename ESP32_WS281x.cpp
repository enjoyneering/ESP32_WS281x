/*
   This is an Arduino library that uses the Espressif ESP32 RMT peripheral to control Adafruit
   NeoPixels, FLORA RGB Smart Pixels, WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, SK6812, etc.

   written by : enjoyneering
   sourse code: https://github.com/enjoyneering/
   based on:    Adafruit_NeoPixel library v1.12.5

   RMT (Remote Control Peripheral) channels:
   - ESP32 has 8 RMT channels for sending & receiving infrared remote control
     signals. Can be assign to any GPIO pins
   - ESP32-S3 has 4 TX channels (to send) & 4 RX channels (to receive) channels for
     infrared remote control signals. DMA access for TX mode on channel 3 & for RX
     mode on channel 7

   ESP32 strapping pins:
   - GPIO0, internal pull-up
   - GPIO2, internal pull-down
   - GPIO4, internal pull-down
   - GPIO5, internal pull-up
   - GPIO12/MTDI, internal pull-down
   - GPIO15/MTDO, internal pull-up
   - GPIO0, 2, 4 & 15 cannot be used on ESP-WROVER due to external connections
     for PSRAM chip
   - GPIO34..39 input only pins. These pins donâ€™t have internal pull-up or
     pull-down resistors

   canShow()

   check whether a call to "show()" will start sending data immediately or will
   'block' for a required interval

   NOTE:
   - LED driver require a short quiet time (about 300 microseconds) after the
     last bit is received before the data 'latches' and new data can start being
     received. Usually one's sketch is implicitly using this time to generate a
     new frame of animation...but if it finishes very quickly, this function
     could be used to see if there's some idle time available for some low-priority
     concurrent task.

   - return true if "show()" will start sending immediately, false if "show()"
     would block (meaning some idle time is available for other tasks)


   - it's normal and possible for "_endTime" to exceed "micros()" if the 32-bit
     clock counter has rolled over (about every 70 minutes). The problem arises
     if code invokes "show()" very infrequently...the "micros()" counter may roll
     over MULTIPLE times in that interval, the delta calculation is no longer correct
     and the next update may stall for a very long time. The check below resets the
     latch counter if a rollover has occurred. This can cause an extra delay of up to
     300 microseconds in the rare case where a "show()" call happens precisely around
     the rollover, but that's neither likely nor especially harmful, vs. other code 
     that might stall for 30+ minutes, or having to document and frequently remind
     and/or provide tech support explaining an unintuitive need for "show()" calls at
     least once an hour

   NOTE:
   - ESP32 may not disable interrupts because "espShow()" uses RMT which tries

   - data latch = 300+ microsecond pause in the output stream. Rather than
     put a delay at the end of the function, the ending time is noted and
     the function will simply hold off (if needed) on issuing the
     subsequent round of data until the latch time has elapsed. This
     allows the mainline code to start generating the next frame of data
     rather than stalling for the latch.

   setBrightness()

   Adjust output brightness. Does not immediately affect what's currently displayed
   on the LEDs. The next call to "show()" will refresh the LEDs at this level.

   NOTE:
   - brightness setting 0..255 (minimum/off to full brightest)
   - this was intended for one-time use in one's setup() function not as an
     animation effect in itself. Because of the way this library "pre-multiplies"
     LED colors in RAM, changing the brightness is often a "lossy" operation what
     you write to pixels isn't necessary the same as what you'll read back.


   - stored brightness value is different than what's passed. This simplifies the
     actual scaling math later, allowing a fast 8x8-bit multiply and taking the
     MSB. 'brightness' is a uint8_t, adding 1 here may (intentionally) roll over...
     so 0 = max brightness (color values are interpreted literally; no scaling),
     1 = min brightness (off), 255 = just below max brightness.

   - re-scale brightness existing data in RAM is potentially "lossy" process
     especially when increasing brightness. The tight timing in the WS2811/WS2812
     code means there aren't enough free cycles to perform this scaling on the fly
     as data is issued. So we make a pass through the existing color data in RAM and
     scale it (subsequent graphics commands also work at this brightness level). If
     there's a significant step up in brightness, the limited number of steps
     (quantization) in the old data will be quite visible in the re-scaled version.
     For a non-destructive change, you'll need to re-render the full strip data.
     C'est la vie.

     discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each

     Red to not-quite-pure-yellow is:        255,   0, 0 to 255, 254,   0
     Pure yellow to not-quite-pure-green is: 255, 255, 0 to   1, 255,   0
     Pure green to not-quite-pure-cyan is:     0, 255, 0 to   0, 255, 254
